# CPEG 672 - Applied Cryptography

This repo contains a variety of code used while working on CPEG672 @ UDEL.
Much of the code is a conglomeration of things the professor provided, things I found, as well as my own work.

I am by no means a legitimate programmer, so if you choose to use any of this, do so at your own risk. This repo is largely to be able to provide relatively easy access to my code for interested parties.
